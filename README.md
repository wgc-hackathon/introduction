## Code of conduct

alternatively you can contact us via the discussions.

## Security

Please make sure that you keep your github details secure and use an appropriate password. Please take care to read the [official github security advice](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure)

You can change your security settings by visiting your profile but here are a few pieces of advice:
- it is recommended that you use 2 factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security.
- it is recommended for you to keep your emails private. You can change this by going to your profile > account settings > emails and check the box which says keep my emails private.

## Be nice

Please treat others as you would expect to be treated yourself. Also please remember that the organisers of the hackathon are trying their best and are working as hard as they can to make this a success. Please feel free to raise any concerns but please do so respectfully, courteously and with understanding. We will do our best to help where we can.

## Have fun

This is the most important piece of advice! We want you to enjoy yourself and get the most out of this event.
